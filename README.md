# deCapital

###This is the repository of deCapital, a decentralized credit market. Through the Ethereum blockchain, deCapital will empower both seekers of capital and holders of capital. Individuals will be capable of applying for credit and investors will be able to lend. deCapital will remove the bank and return financial power to the individual.

deCapital works by allowing a user to apply for a loan under the borrow tab. These new applications will show up under the lend tab, where other users can fund the loans. Each user has a dashboard where he or she can make payments on outstanding debt and view the status of their investments.
